# Google-Homepage Project

# The Odin Project Foundations Course- Practice Project

Deconstructing and rebuilding a Google Search results page. #Updates:

- Fixed a lot of positioning issues with CSS
- Fixed HTML document
- Added Comments where I was having Issues

# Learning Diary:

I was nervous at first to start this project, then I realized if I don’t start then I won’t learn.
I need to go back and rewrite the HTML doc.
I will get comfortable at naming, for now I wanted to keep it simple and as I go along the course I will continue to make improvements.

# TO-DO:

- Figure out how to add: About and Store link on the top left of the header without running into major styling issues
- Figure out how to get rid of the line between the Search and Lucky button
- Add hover features to the header
- Start from scratch and remake the site.
